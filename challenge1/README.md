# Chai Calculator

This is a simple JavaScript project that helps you figure out how much of each ingredient you need to make Kenyan Chai Bora.

The program asks you how many cups of chai you want, then calculates and shows you the amount of water, milk, tea leaves, and sugar needed for that number of cups.
